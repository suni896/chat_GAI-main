Bob,Hello! How can I help you regarding climate change today?,2024-12-24 17:42:13
Anna,Why spend trillions on climate change when we could use that money to solve immediate issues like poverty and healthcare?,2024-12-24 17:42:26
Bob,"Addressing climate change is also an investment in preventing future crises that can exacerbate poverty and health problems. Climate change impacts, such as extreme weather, can destroy infrastructure, homes, and livelihoods, ultimately costing much more than preventive measures and making immediate issues worse.",2024-12-24 17:42:40

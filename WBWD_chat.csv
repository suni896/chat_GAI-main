lily HUMAN_____^^^,how about sea level rising,2024-12-27 14:09:46
Bob,"Sea levels are rising primarily due to two factors: the melting of ice sheets and glaciers, and the thermal expansion of seawater as it warms. This rise is accelerating and poses significant risks to coastal communities and ecosystems.",2024-12-27 14:09:54
Anna,Why should we heavily fund climate change mitigation measures when the return on investment is uncertain and the economic models predicting future risks are highly variable and speculative?,2024-12-27 14:10:26
Bob,"Investing in climate change mitigation is essential because the potential costs of inaction could far exceed the costs of proactive measures. While economic models have variability, the overwhelming scientific consensus indicates that climate change will bring severe consequences, including extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, and health impacts. Preventative actions can safeguard economies, reduce long-term damages, and protect future generations.",2024-12-27 14:10:34

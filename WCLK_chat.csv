Anna,Why should we invest heavily in climate change mitigation if the economic models predicting future damage have significant uncertainties?,2024-12-23 15:43:28
Bob,"Investing in climate change mitigation reduces the risk of severe economic damage, loss of life, and environmental degradation. The costs of inaction, such as extreme weather events and ecosystem collapse, are likely to far exceed the costs of proactive measures. Moreover, transitioning to a greener economy can create jobs and drive innovation.",2024-12-23 15:43:55
